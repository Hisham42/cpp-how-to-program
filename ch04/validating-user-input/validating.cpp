/*(Validating User Input) The examination-results program of Fig. 4.14 assumes that any val-
ue input by the user thatâ€™s not a 1 must be a 2. Modify the application to validate its inputs. On any
input, if the value entered is other than 1 or 2, keep looping until the user enters a correct value.*/
